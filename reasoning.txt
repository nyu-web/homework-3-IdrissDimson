For the header, I used flexbox because I needed to set the items into a row and Flexbox proivided a way to do that simply. For the layout of the webpage, i set the height to 100vh to cover the webpage completely. Then, I used CSS Grid to set the layout of the webpage. I set the columns to 5 columns because I wanted the center section to be longer than the other sections, to look better. I set the rows to three for visual reasons as well. the last column was grouped together because having them in different rows didn't look as nice. Finally, I grouped the h1's and p's together in the article tags to get the img tags to the right of the text.
